Sorrow — yet another line in between boyhood and a man

*Remember not our faulty pieces
Remember not our rusted parts
It's not the petty imperfections that define us but
The way we hold our hearts
And the way we hold our heads
I hope they write your names beside mine on my gravestone when I'm dead
And when we are dead let our voices carry on*

Find a beeter song to sing along

Humility — the abilty to be of help to the humanity /even if...

I've never been too quick 
Always taking the things as they come
Hard to deliver
And I respond how I feel fit to the world
And harbor our love
