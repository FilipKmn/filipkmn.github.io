**Sorrow** — yet another line in between boyhood and a man
<br>

Designed to be enjoying life,<br>
Being in between deities, <br>
Sipping the left over nectar<br>
Happly embacing the all life<br>
<br>

*Remember not our faulty pieces<br>
Remember not our rusted parts<br>
It's not the petty imperfections that define us but<br>
The way we hold our hearts<br>
And the way we hold our heads<br>
I hope they write your names beside mine on my gravestone when I'm dead<br>
And when we are dead let our voices carry on*<br>
<br>

Find a beeter song to sing along
<br>

**Humility** — the abilty to be of help to the humanity /even if...
<br>

I've never been too quick <br>
Always taking the things as they come<br>
Hard to deliver<br>
And I respond how I feel fit<br>


**Harbor[ing]** — or haven, is a matter of water, too seek shelter from storms

[fika] — having a break, most often a coffee break, with one's colleagues, friends, date or family
