Product guy with marketing in his heart and tech in his blood. Love building exceptional software that ends up helping people.

When not working, you’ll find me cultivating a vigorous spirit through the martial art of Kendo, hanging out in the forest with my mountain bike, with a big happy grin, and snapping photos every once in a while — rarely people comment that they are good. One day I hope to fulfill my boyhood dream and learn to fly (a plane).

_Fun fact:_ Learned the most when the startup I co-funded burned and crashed back in 2012.

### Work Experience:



**[Alchemy](https://alchemy.cloud/)** — _Product Marketing_

Building a vertical SaaS that facilitates the commercialization of new formulations in the specialty chemistry industry (a nearly $1 trillion global market). 

Most of the time juggling in between the product marketing, customer success, and product development. 

**[dryTools](http://drytools.co/)** — _Product Marketing and development_

Developing [Sifu](https://codesifu.com/) — software development tool that made it possible to make applications go from zero to awesome in no time. 

Working on Sifu was great, I was the only non-tech person there and was leading all of the marketing efforts as both doing some business development.

**[Rendered Text](http://renderedtext.com/)** — _Marketing and Analytics [and more]_

Making Semaphore happen and helping software development teams move faster with it's hosted continuous integration and delivery service. With over thousand customers including Intel, Ebay, 500px Semaphore is making a real bang in the development community.

Semaphore was and is my most favorite project, and there I've worked day and night, from finding ways how to grow our user base to organizing tech events. Semaphore holds a special place in my heart and as a product best represents me as a professional product person.

**[Prognosis IT](http://www.renator.net/)** — _Junior Product Manager_

Got through the thick of with while learning how to deliver a cloud-based application. 

The first major project I was involved with, a social network for the Sweedish market. A major stepping stone in learning how to get requirements from people and deliver software on time.

**[Dejan Marketing](https://dejanseo.com.au/)** — _Online Marketing Coordinator_

Working for a digital marketing agency isn't as dull as it is sound, as long as you are set on learning the most you can and moving on even faster.

I've learned the ropes about digital marketing, from SEO and content marketing to A/B testing.

**[Univerexport](https://univerexport.rs/)** — _Marketing Intern_

Univerexport, one of the biggest retailers in Serbia. While studying, I've gotten a chance to be a part of the team that built the first online retail application on the Serbian market, eLakolije.
