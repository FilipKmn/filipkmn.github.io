I love making things and software for that matter! 

What motivates me is the joy of creating a piece of software and seeing it help people in they everyday life. 

I'm a cheerful product guy, with marketing in his heart and tech in his blood. Loving every moment of building exceptional software that ends up helping people.

When not working, you’ll find me cultivating a vigorous spirit through the martial art of Kendo, hanging out in the forest with my mountain bike, with a big happy grin, and snapping photos every once in a while — rarely people comment that they are good. One day I hope to fulfill my boyhood dream and learn to fly (a plane).

_Fun fact:_ Learned the most when the startup I co-funded burned and crashed back in 2013.

### Work Experience:



**[Alchemy](https://alchemy.cloud/)** — _Product Marketing_

Building a vertical SaaS that facilitates the commercialization of new formulations in the specialty chemistry industry (a nearly $1 trillion global market). 

Most of the time juggling in between the product marketing, customer success, and product development. 

**[dryTools](http://drytools.co/)** — _Product Marketing and development_

Developing [Sifu](https://codesifu.com/) — a software development tool that made it possible to make applications go from zero to awesome in no time. 

Working on Sifu was great, I was the only non-tech person there and was leading all of the marketing efforts as both doing some business development and getting down and dirty with VC's.

**[Rendered Text](http://renderedtext.com/)** — _Marketing and Analytics [and more]_

Making [Semaphore](semaphoreci.com) happen and helping software development teams move faster throught development thanks to our product — a hosted continuous integration and delivery service. With over thousand customers including the likes of Intel, Ebay, 500px Semaphore is making a real bang in the development community.

Semaphore was and is my most favorite product. I've worked day and night, and all wiht a smile. From finding ways how to grow our user base to organizing tech events. Semaphore holds a special place in my heart and as a product best represents me as a professional product person.

**[Prognosis IT](http://www.renator.net/)** — _Junior Product Manager_

Got through the thick of it while learning how to deliver my first cloud-based application. 

The first major project I was involved with, a social network for the Sweedish market. A big stepping stone for me, learning how to get requirements from clients and deliver software on time.

**[Dejan Marketing](https://dejanseo.com.au/)** — _Online Marketing Coordinator_

Working for a digital marketing agency isn't as dull as it is sound, as long as you are set on learning the most you can and moving on even faster.

I've learned the ropes on digital marketing here, from SEO and content marketing to A/B testing. Not all the projects were cool, like working on optimizing the website for an garage door reseller, but some were awesome, like working for on of Expedia's spin-offs.

**[Univerexport](https://univerexport.rs/)** — _Marketing Intern_

Univerexport, one of the biggest retailers in Serbia. Who would tell! While studying, I've gotten a chance to be a part of the team that built the first online retail application on the Serbian market, eLakolije. Didn't do much there, was fun either way.
