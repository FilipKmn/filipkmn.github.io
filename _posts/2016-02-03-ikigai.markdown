*Mastering the concept of Ikigai 生き甲斐*

Just recently, I had a rather long and profound talk about the life/work balance with one of my closest friends. At the end of the talk, we both agreed that we need to be more happy and content when at work.

That same evening I stumbled upon the Japanese concept of Ikigai - "a reason for being". It's really simple, so simple it's represented best by a diagram.

Look!

Enough from me. [Read more about Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) or [watch a TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100?language=en) about the concept of Ikigai.

'till next time.
Take care and have a great day!⛩
