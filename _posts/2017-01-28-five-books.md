_Product Marking is a mess of a job. A lovely mess but still a mess. According to the job description, you are somewhere in between a product developer and a full-stack marketer._

To gain the skills need one must go deep into the both spheres. So here are the top five of the books: 

**Writing that works** by Kenneth Roman and Joel Raphaelson

Write to make a point, write to be clear, write to get things done. All this in one book, the most 'to the point' book I've ever seen (read). Kenneth and Joel pulled all of their collective knowledge into helping us communicate effectively in business.

**User Stroy Mapping** by Jeff Patton

Reading at the moment, and thinking why I have not read it earlier. 50 pages in and this book are one of my most favorite. Can wait to read it, use it and then re-read it. 

**Crossing the Chasm** by Geoffrey Moore

If you're trying to disrupt an industry or trying to be innovative in any sense, and you are for sure, then this book is meant for you. No more, no less.

**Insanely Simple** by Ken Segall

Cupertino mode on! More of a novel, then a business book. 'Insanely Simple' is just about that, how to keep your marketing and your product as simple as it's humanly possible. Ken worked for Apple almost from the start and was involved in Next as an external marketer. A fun and inspiring read.

**Principles of Marketing**  by Philip Kotler

This the go-to book for marketing in general. I've read it a few times while in Uni and a few times since. It's a sort of a marketing bible, Kotler defined much of the marketing as we know it today and you'll find all the basics and ground principles of good marketing. Read it once, and it's the same as having a Bachelor degree in marketing, not kidding.
