_As a product marketer one is heavy on both marketing and product tasks, so the toolset of a product marketing person must reflect one self and the team building the product._

Everybody has their favorite stack, so here is my take on it:

1. **Waffle** – an automated project management tool powered by your GitHub

Keeps you in sync with all things happening in development, and allows me to add new features and issues — making me unpopular with the engineering team. 

2. **G-Drive** – don't know what I would do without it

Easy to make, easy to share, never lose any data, what else is there to say about G-Drive.

3. **Intercom** – makes engaging the user so easy it like squeezing lemons

Intercom, my first love when it comes to a customer messaging platform. You're expensive as hell, when we scale users I want to cry every month we the bill comes in... but you're so awesome. To honest HelpScout, think I'm switching to HelpScout, but psttttt... and I want a dip into the Drip.

4. **Writing that works** – a book actually...

An awesome book, making you write better every time you have read it. This book is a tool, trust me it is. No better way to start writing better than reading through this book. Just read it.

5. **Balsamiq** – to mock and mock and mock around some more

Use it a lot. I have what they would say an excited hand, and I often go around drawing and doodling on the same paper I try to sketch an idea. Balsamiq lets me get it concise and easy to share.

I'm really enthusiastic when it comes to tools and automations, and often try to experiment. Though, I think that tools are not so important, the important thing is to develop and keep optimizing the processes behind them. Tools are just fun to use and set up, but some serious thought must be implemented in the whole process, else they are useless.
