Recently I had to envision the backbone of an admin dashboard on a new product I'm developing. In short, it was hard and the only thing I thought would be rational was to do some reverse engineering and make me a simple profits and losses spreadsheet. This way I filtered out the data that was available to me without using up too much of the teams engineering time.

I had set up the main KPI's I'm going to track in the first quarter and that I assume would be relevant data. To make a long story short, [take a look at the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kkl4iQsA5U9zw3dfzwd4kR13yOXYEjXZBOwpWfuV4Pg/edit?usp=sharing) I made and be free to use it and upgrade it for your needs.

If you have any tips, suggestions or any other ideas, please ping me [@filipkmn](https://twitter.com/FilipKmn). I'd appreciate it.

'tll nex time, take care!
