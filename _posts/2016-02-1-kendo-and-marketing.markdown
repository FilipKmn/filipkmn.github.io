*Personal opinion warning!!!
This post is mostly about my views on how Kendo and how it may help in everyday life.*

Ok, I'll be cut to the point at the start. I'm going to try to "sell" you the idea of training Kendo. Why? Because it's good for you.

I don’t want to talk too much about what's Kendo and accidentally bore you at the very beginning. In short, Kendo is a way to help you evolve professionally and way more importantly to help you become a better human being. You're not going to gain a Bruce Lee style body from practicing Kendo (although that happens, but not in my case) and you're not going to be having a light-saber duel with the Dark Side. Instead, with Kendo you're going to be given a chance to fight with yourself and your all so many weekends. Practiced correctly, Kendo becomes a tool to shape one's mind and it helps you evolve as a human being.

Huh, the last sentence sounded a bit too hokus-pokus and probably overly spiritual. Truth be told Kendo is not a spiritual experience (meaning nothing it has nothing to do with religion, e.g. Buddhism). But it has some of the "mind over body" aspects planted deeply in its learings and is, for me atlest, one of the main reassons of practicing. On the other hand, it has a lot od physical benefits, not only you building muscle, but you sharpening the senses in the everyday situation, shortening reaction time and helping you develop a deeper focus.

I'll take a shortcut on explaining further what's Kendo. Tadammm, here's a video. It's interesting and fun to watch and probably the best introduction to Kendo for people who have never heard or seen Kendo before.

*disclosure: it may seem intimidating, painful or even funny watching*

I couldn't resist it, here is another great video.

OK now that you have seen Kendo in action and heard better explanations on what's Kendo, from people that have a more deeper understanding of Kendo than me, I can share with you some of my experiences and thoughts.

###Simplicity

One of the first lessons you learn in Kendo is simplicity — simplicity is the way. The other lesson you learn when you practice Kendo is that achieving simplicity is hard. O'boy is it hard. Complicating things just aren't the way to go. Even if something flashier, with all of the bells and whistles around it, it's not better. It’s really the opposite of that wich makes something/someone great. This applies to Kendo, everyday life, and marketing. In Kendo, the simpler your moves are and the simpler your strike is the better fighter you become. In marketing, the simpler you write, the clearer you message is. Simplicity is hard to achieve, sure, and it takes a lot of work, but taking the easy path is never the best path. At least, I see it like that.

Doing something as simple as possible is a challenge and a hard one — simple is (very) difficult. So is within the art of Kendo and all things marketing, you can treat simplicity as a weapon. Kendo developed that sense of simplicity and lets you polish it in the Dojo, letting you use same principles of achieving simplicity at work.

[Insanely Simple](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Insanely-Simple-Obsession-Drives-Success/dp/067092119X) is a short and a sweet read for all marketers. It gets you deep in the action at Cupertino and how they used the principle of simplicity to develop superior product and marketing.

###Playing the "mind games"

As a beginner, over time, you notice that with Kendo as you practice your body, you start practicing your mind. As you progress you stat to practice the mind more and more and the body less (better be said you keep it at a constant level). This is the real game changer in training Kendo. Realizing that in a physical discipline, you train the mind more intensively than the body. You train the mind ad you start to see how your begins to evolve Kendo on a higher level. You have that realization, that if your mind breaks, your body breaks as well and you die. If you can’t keep focus, you die. Okay, it's not that drastic, but you get the point. When Kendo was developed one was training to will in combat and not be lose focus and be killed in the battlefields. Body can take you only so far. Your mind and its abilities are what matters if you want to evolve. For me, this is the essence of training Kendo.

It's hard to focus and Kendo teaches you just that. You have to have your focus up all of the time or you're going to lose, at some point. Your focus is down, you loose. You get angry at yourself for losing. But losing is a good thing if you can accept it, that is. And this is kind of a paradigm in Kendo, it's good to lose. By losing you get to know your weaknesses. You get used to losing, a lot. Anybody can define you. When you make a marketing campaign that has no ROI you learn from it and adapt. Kendo helps get you the most out of loses.

Mind games are for sure the core aspect of Kendo and one I found most beneficial in my daily life. After years of doing Kendo, you start to see how you can affect other people's decision with your mind if you train it right. It's like using the force, but not as cool. You start to see how you came to be much calmer in stressful situations. You are harder to "read" and your reactions are more controllable. In Kendo, you use your mental abilities to provoke your opponents actions, anticipate their moves and stay calm and focused. It's really easy to apply what you have learned in Kendo to other situations.

Knowing yourself, you get to know other people better and get to anticipate their actions. This a great perk of Kendo, developing that sense for other people's actions. When you're in a Kendo fight you have to know your opponents next move. When you are with your customer you have known what he is thinking and how you can give that value he needs.

Everything is an opportunity to make your mind stronger. In fact, a strong mind means that you’re able to push your body further, which makes your body stronger too. If you don’t have the mind(set), you can never develop further.

###Humility - I'm a beginner for life

After only practicing Kendo for more than 12 years I feel as an absolute beginner. I'm liking it that way. I want to feel like a beginner for life. I really don't know much about Kendo or for the matter of fact neither about marketing, or life. :) But, I want to learn and find out more. Personally, and probably most of Kendo people would agree with me, ego is the biggest problem. Ego is the one that stops from you acknowledging you are a beginner at any point in your life, and ego stops you advancing. Kendo is a terminator of one's ego. You get to see yourself in a much more objective way.

Humility and ego have close ties. Achieving humility is easy, eliminate the ego as much as you can. Simple.

###Is Kendo for you?

Probably not. Why? I've seen a lot of beginners come and go. Kendo's concepts are hard to grasp and it's techniques are hard to master. This is often a detour for the beginners, as they don't see any progress for months.

All that being said, you should definitely give Kendo a try. Find a local Kendo club. See the practice live. Give it try. You may find you like it and one day maybe will be seeing each in Keiko.

Here is a good way of finding a local Kendo club - [Budo Finder](https://budofinder.com/events/kendo-event/?etype=upcoming).

###In short  

For me, Kendo is that endless spiritual journey. Kendo has a much deeper meaning than I could even begin to describe or write about. It helps me evolve as a human being. It's also been a force that keeps me going through the times. I'm thankful that I can do Kendo and I'm deeply grateful to all before me that made it possible for me to practice it.


'till next time,
